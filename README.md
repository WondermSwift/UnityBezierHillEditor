# BÃ©zier Curve Tool for Creating 2D Physically Simulated Hills

This is a demo for a tool I created in Unity. It allows you to create 2D "hills" which have physics collisions (ala [Tiny Wings](https://www.google.com/search?q=tiny+wings&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSvpezrqncAhVDWqwKHcGpBJwQ_AUICygC&biw=1440&bih=758#imgrc=DEBZXPcEKjSJLM:)).

I originally developed this tool to aid in level design for a game I was working on at the time.

Please note that this is a demo project and the code wasn't necessarily written with the intent of anyone ever seeing it.

Liscense: Do whatever you want with this code for personal use.
